# Diabetes-Detection

Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning with Python
	ML Project predicting the diabetic and Non- diabetic cases based on their Other health factors like (Glucos, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, Age, etc.)

We applied a wide variety of models and libraries like (StandardScaler, svm "support vector Machine Classifier", accuracy_score, etc.) which helped us to get the highest accuracy from the dataset values.
Document Localization:

- The objective of this project is to detect the diabetic and Non- diabetic cases 

•	First, we Explore the dataset to know how many  diabetic and Non- diabetic  cases we have and removing the (Outcome) field which tell us if its diabetic case or not.

•	Second, we applying Data Standardization with the StandardScaler.

•	Third, we spliting the data with Train and Test Split then getting the accuracy score on each one of them, and finally bulding a Predictive System.
